# Flashcards Solo Project

## Overview: 

This project sought to hone and refine the tenets of OOP through classes, as well the principals of TDD and SRP. The end result is a flashcards game that exists on the CLI (command line interface) where a user is prompted with a question, presented three options to select from, and outputted a result of whether their guess was correct or not. Repeating until all objects in the deck have been cycled through.
