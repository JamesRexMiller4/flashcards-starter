# Flashcards Solo Project

## Overview: 

This project sought to hone and refine the tenants of OOP through classes, as well the principals of TDD and SRP (Object Oriented Programming,
Test Driven Development, and Singular Responsibility Principle). The comp required that we build out a Card, Deck, Turn, Round, and Game classes
through incremental unit testing. For each class object there is an associated test file that serves to verify that each object instance is behaving
as expected. The end result is a flashcards game that exists on the CLI (command line interface) where a user is prompted with a question, presented
three options to select from, and outputted a result of whether their guess was correct or not. Repeating until all objects in the deck have been cycled
through.
